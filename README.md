# TelemSIM

Telemetry Station Simulator (TelemSIM) lets you simulate the behavior of the telemetry station to send out telemetry data through multiple ethernet channels for Functional and stress integration testing.

### Motivation

I've written a number of simulation programs in C, and I always ended up writing my own post-incident processing as alternative for the real-time data process utility. Finally, I decided to develop a general multiple channels message sender for the future software V&V (Verification and validation) work.
